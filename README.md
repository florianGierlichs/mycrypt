## Develop

Feel free to clone the project and play around with it.

Install client and server dependencies:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

You will need a .env file with a database_URL.
The file should look like this:

DB_CONNECTION=<DB_URL>

DB_NAME=<DB_NAME>

I would suggest using [my-json-server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) for testing.

To run the project use:

```
npm run client
npm run server
```
